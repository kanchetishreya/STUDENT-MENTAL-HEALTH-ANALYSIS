# STUDENT-MENTAL-HEALTH-ANALYSIS
This project analyzes a student mental health dataset using SQL to identify behavioral patterns, risk factors, and correlations between academic performance and mental well-being. The analysis focuses on understanding how various demographic and academic attributes—such as age, gender, marital status, CGPA, course, and year of study—relate to mental health issues including depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.

The project includes several key insights:

Distribution of mental health issues across gender, age groups, and marital status.

Relationship between academic performance (CGPA) and mental health conditions.

Identification of courses and year–course combinations with the highest and lowest mental health concerns.

Determining which mental health issue is most common among students who sought specialist treatment.

Calculating overall risk scores for students based on a numeric scoring system.

Evaluating the percentage of affected students across multiple demographic groups.

The analysis was performed using SQL aggregations, conditional logic (CASE), grouping, joins, and view creation.
This repository demonstrates practical SQL skills for real-world data analysis, including query optimization and structured reporting.
